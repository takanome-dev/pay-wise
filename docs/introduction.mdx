## What is Pay Wise?

**"Pay Wise"** is an **open source** platform that empowers developers to easily handle payments for their side projects. We understand that integrating payment processing into your projects can be time-consuming and challenging. With "Pay Wise", you can focus on what you do best — building and enhancing your side projects — while leaving the payment processing to us.

Our platform provides an intuitive API that lets you generate cards specifically for your side projects. **These cards aren't real credit cards**; they're virtual cards that allow you to accept payments securely within your projects. By integrating our API, you can enable seamless transactions between your users and your side projects, all while avoiding the complexities of traditional payment gateways.

In addition to card generation, **"Pay Wise"** also offers the ability to create customers and manage their payment details. This feature ensures that you have a streamlined process for handling transactions and staying organized, without the need for extensive backend development.

With "Pay Wise", we're committed to simplifying the payment experience for developers, helping you monetize your side projects effortlessly. Dive into our documentation to learn how to get started, integrate our API, and take full advantage of the features we offer. Let's embark on a journey to make payment handling hassle-free and efficient!
