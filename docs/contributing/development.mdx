## Local Development

Step 1. Fork the [Pay Wise repository](https://github.com/takanome-dev/paywise) on GitHub.

Step 2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pay-wise.git
```

Step 3. Navigate to the cloned directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd pay-wise && pnpm install
```

<Info>
  This repo is a monorepo that uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package
  manager. Running `pnpm install` will install all dependencies for all packages
  in the monorepo.
</Info>

Step 5. Run the development server.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start all the apps in the monorepo. You can access the web app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The API server is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). And for the documentation, it's not started when running `pnpm dev`, you need to run `cd docs && pnpm dev` to start it and access it at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Gotta figure out how to start it with the other apps.
If you do, please open a PR! ðŸ˜ƒ
