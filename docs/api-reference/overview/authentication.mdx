## API Key Generation

Before you can start making requests to the **Pay Wise API**, you'll need to generate an API key. To do this:

1. Log in to your **Pay Wise** account.
2. Navigate to the settings section within your dashboard and click on the **API Keys** tab.
3. Generate a new API key and copy it to a secure location.

<Warning>
  Treat your API key as confidential information and avoid sharing it publicly.
  It's a best practice to store your API key in an environment variable and
  reference it in your code. If you suspect that your API key has been
  compromised, you can regenerate it at any time.
</Warning>

## Including API Keys in Requests

To authenticate your requests, you'll need to include your API key as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header of your request. For example:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/v1/cards \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```javascript javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/v1/cards', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
});
```

```python python
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("localhost:3000")

headers = { 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }

conn.request("GET", "/v1/cards", headers=headers)

res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()

print(data.decode("utf-8"))
```

</CodeGroup>

Feel free to open an issue if you want to see examples in other languages.

## Base URL

The base URL for all requests is `http://localhost:3000/v1/`. All requests are served over HTTPS. Unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

## API Versioning

The **Pay Wise API** is currently on version `v1`. We may release new versions of the API from time to time. However, we'll always support older versions of the API for a reasonable amount of time.

## Pagination

Some API endpoints return a list of resources. For example, the [List Cards](/docs/api-reference/cards/list-cards) endpoint returns a list of cards. To improve performance, the API returns paginated results by default. You can specify the number of results to return per page by passing the `per_page` query parameter. For example, to return 10 cards per page, you would pass the `per_page=10` query parameter.

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl --request GET \
  --url 'http://localhost:3000/v1/cards?per_page=10' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```javascript javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/v1/cards?per_page=10', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

The API will return a `meta` property in the response which includes pagination information. For example:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "card_1J5X2e2eZvKYlo2C0X2e2eZv",
      "last4": "4242",
      "exp_month": 8,
      "exp_year": 2022,
      "brand": "Visa"
      // ...
    }
  ],
  // well this is not actually the response, will be updated soon
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "next_page": 2,
    "prev_page": null,
    "total_pages": 2,
    "total_count": 11
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

If your request fails, the API will return an error response with an appropriate status code and an error message. For example, if you try to create a card with an invalid API key, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response with the following body:

```json
{
  {
    "statusCode": 401,
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "The API key you provided is invalid."
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and ensure a high quality of service for all users, the API enforces rate limits on all requests. If you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "code": "too_many_requests",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later."
}
```

<Note> Rate limiting is not implemented yet, don't forget to update this</Note>

Each IP address is limited to 60 requests per minute. This is measured by saving the timestamp of the first request in a minute and the number of requests made in that minute. If the number of requests exceeds 60, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
